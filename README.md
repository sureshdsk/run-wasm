## Goal of the project

The goal of this project is to build an easy way to execute various programming languages in React via WebAssembly.

People should be able to use this project to embed executable code snippets on their websites easily!

We're building this as new component to be used inside the [Slip](https://www.slip.so) authoring tool.
